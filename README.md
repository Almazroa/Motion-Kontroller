# Wearable Bluetooth Motion Controller

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed by Reem AI Mazroa, Sissi Liu, & Yuvakshi Kalra as part of our University of Wisconsin-Madison ECE capstone project.
Demos for this project were conducted on Krunkr.io, a First Person Shooter game.

## Introduction
This project focuses on creating a wearable Bluetooth motion controller for gaming, designed to transform traditional gameplay into an immersive experience. Running on Infineon's PSoC 6, this controller combines motion tracking via accelerometers and gyroscopes, tactile buttons, haptic feedback, and an LCD screen for status monitoring. By leveraging the PSoC 63 BLE module, the controller connects to a PC via Bluetooth to deliver precise control and seamless interaction with PC games.

## Features & UI
- **Motion Tracking:**
  Using an IMU on each hand, the player can intuitively interact with the game. Wrist tilts are detected and reflected in the game to move the camera and character.
- **LCD Display:**  
  Located on the right hand, the LCD screen displays important device information, such as battery level and Bluetooth status.
- **Tactile Buttons:**  
  With six buttons on each hand, the controller allows for comprehensive mapping of game controls, providing a complete gaming experience.
- **Haptic Feedback:**
  Designed for immersive gameplay, the side buttons, used for shooting, offer haptic feedback using flat coin vibration motors.
- **Rechargeable Power System:**  
  Includes a 3.7V lithium-ion battery, USB charging, voltage monitors, reverse power protection, and power boosters for safe and efficient operation.
  - **Bluetooth Communication:**  
  Transmits game control signals reliably via Bluetooth 5.0.
